=head1 NAME

Crypt::SDTree - Subset Difference Encryption/Revocation Scheme 

=head1 ABSTRACT

Implementation of a broadcast encryption/revocation scheme

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This library implements a broadcast encryption and revocation scheme.
The basic scheme that is implemented here was proposed by Naor et al.
in the paper "Revocation and Tracing Schemes for Stateless Receivers".

To be more detailed, this module allows encryption of a message to a
group of users, where a subset of this group is considered to be revoked.
All non-revoked users will be able to decrypt the message, while the 
revoked users will not. The receivers are stateless and do not have to 
update any state from session to session. 

The functionality is split into two sub-packages. To encrypt or send data, 
please refer to L<Crypt::SDTree::Publish>. To decrypt or receive data,
please refer to L<Crypt::SDTree::Subscribe>.

Please note that this module has not been reviewed by anyone other than
myself. I am not sure that it actually is secure - while the theoretical
basis should be sound it might leak key material or have other implementation
defects.

Hence, please consult a cryptographer before using this for anything that
is actually important.
